### Double Nested IntersectionObserver
The margins and the paralax effect are both IO with the parallax being in the html so we can use img or picture tag and doesn't use scroll events

### SVG overlays on images

### Dist files
[Seperate Repo](https://github.com/rileybathurst/NZTG-Dist) pushed from hosting - this needs to move

# Issues

- I'm using node-sass which is depricated this needs to be fixed
- remove "compression-webpack-plugin": "^7.1.2", until I get the build working
- commenting out images to see if that fixes the build
- Removed the extract-loader until build
- I had a gitignore on the images, let's go find them
- get rid of the old hosting
- I probably don't need the same compression now I'm going through netlify?
