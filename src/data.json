      "test" : "Dear Richard Just a very quick note to let you know how much I enjoyed the tour of South Island with you! It seems like a very long time ago now and I can hardly believe I was lucky enough to come, but what an opportunity! As I’m sure you know, all of our group had a fantastic time and really appreciated your expert skills as tour guide, and your good humoured company. I will certainly be recommending you to clients. Having talked endlessly about NZ since I got home, my husband is feeling suitably left out, so we will definitely plan to visit again together. Would love to make it for the rugby world cup, but will have to see how the finances work out. Will be in touch when we have a plan. Once again, thank you for making it such a great trip. Best regards to you and Heather.",
